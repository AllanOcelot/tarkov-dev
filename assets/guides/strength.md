# Strength guide

By Kokarn

The best way to level strength is to load up a *documents case* full of *sas drive* and keep in your secure container.

For a *Secure Container Gamma* you can fit 4 of these. Each *sas drive* weighs 0.3 kg and a *documents case* can fit 16 of them, so 4.8 kg / *documents case* for a total of 19.2 kg just in your secure container.
