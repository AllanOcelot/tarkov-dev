## History üìö

This project ([tarkov-dev](https://github.com/the-hideout/tarkov-dev)) is a fork of [tarkov-tools.com](https://github.com/kokarn/tarkov-tools). The original creator [@kokarn](https://github.com/kokarn) decided to shut the site down. In the spirit of opensource, a group of developers came together to revive the site in order to continue providing a great website for the Tarkov community and an API to power further development for creators. This project is now 100% opensource and developer first. Our GitHub Organization ([the-hideout](https://github.com/the-hideout)) contains all the repos which power the API, this website, the community Discord bot, server infrastructure, and much more! We are passionate about opensource and love pull requests to improve our ecosystem for all.

## We ‚ù§Ô∏è Pull Requests

We love pull request and contributors looking to improve this project! Anything from simple spelling errors, icon updates, fixes for small css bugs or just posting issues to keep track of what needs to be done is greatly appreciated.
